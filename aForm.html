      Our Inspiration 
    </div>
     
    <p>
    The bulletin board in the B.C. intended to help students organize carpools to and from campus before and after holidays is still mostly bare as we approach the end of the semester. As final exams wrap up and students begin to leave campus there will be many facebook posts from people desperately seeking a ride to the Smokehouse in Monteagle or all the way to the Nashville airport. It is also common for students to try to organize rides back to their home states and towns, and our website is intended to facilitate the &quot;campus commute.&quot; We want it to be easy and unstressful for students to find ways to campus and back home, so welcome to the digital &quot;hitch a ride&quot; board!
